  With your support, you’ll help us cover Hoodie’s expenses towards our goal of
  becoming a fully independent, self-sustained Open Source community! Our
  expenses are low (stickers, hosting, some travel), but to sustain Hoodie in
  the long term, we need dedicated people to serve the community. Our milestones
  are: Part-time community manager position ($10,000+ per year), Part-time
  fundraising position ($20,000+ per year) and Full-time community manager
  position ($60,000+ per year)
