# Project Folder

This folder provides a module which can be required from anywhere inside of the parent and be a useful way of accessing metadata about the projects and subprojects such as git commit status, information about the different distributions, their dependencies, their build manifests, and other things of that nature.

It also provides a pretty CLI and ES6 compatible REPL console that resolves and displays promises for you automatically. These are dynamically configured just for this project, and provide you with the ability to inspecting or render anything on demand, interact with our APIs, git repositories.
